# Console-Based-Chess-Board
Author: Rhydian Windsor (2016)
Description: 
I wrote this command line based chess program as my final project for a course I took at university, "Object Orientated Programming in C++"
The idea was to write a program with a sophisticated class hierarchy that uses some of the C++ features we learnt over the past few weeks.
The report I wrote on the project is available in this repository; "ChessBoardReport.pdf"
